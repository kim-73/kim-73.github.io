                    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>You get additional insurance coverage for the time you are 'just' riding your bike at the same level as the great coverage you get in competition.</li>

              <p class="italic">* Why do casual and social rides cost $5? This is what is called a participation certificate, it indemnifies the club and/or ride leader in the event of an incident causing injury or damage to the public. It is a cost charged to us by the peak body MTBA and in now way makes any money for the club or ride leaders. You'll notice this is not payable for Club or Race members as their membership fee covers that already. Please <span class="paraLink"><a href="#">Click here </a></span>to find out more.</p>
