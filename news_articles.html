        <h1>Thredbo trip</h1>
        <p class="mulPara">Last weekend Sydney MTB Riders headed to Thredbo to shred the trails one last time on the last weekend of the MTB season. We had a weekend of varying weather with rain, snow and lots of mud! Thredbo MTB called us on our way down to warn that the trails had been closed all week and may not open for the weekend. When we arrived on the Friday the lifts were shut down and the place was quiet. Things didn't look good!</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>Saturday morning arrived and after having an amazing breakfast at the Silver Brumby we watched as they loaded up the lifts! Hazzaar!</p>

<p>1st run of the day we had light rain on our way up the lifts, by the time we got to the top we were keen as mustard to ride the flow trail. That was fun and scary at the same time! So much mud but the trail was in good shape after not being ridden all week. Back up to the top, this time a little muddier and wet and much colder as the wind ate into our water and mud sodden gloves and clothing.</p>

<p>We stop for lunch and chow down on some huge schnitzel burgers while we warm our hands and dry our gloves on the heater and reflect on the craziness of the day so far.</p>

<p>Andrew, who arrived in his riding shorts, decides it's a good time to go get changed into some more appropriate attire.</p>

<p>The rest of us head back up for a couple more rides. Frozen fingers and mud everywhere we decide five runs is about our limit for the day and head back to the brumby for some amazing dinner and a few bevvies.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>It’s a bit warmer, no snow and we head up to the top after some maintenance on both ourselves and our bikes. Today we decide to mix it up a little and brave the Cannonball downhill trail.</p>

<p>We made several runs mixing up the DH and Flow trails and crossing over at various points. The mud was getting deep and those braking ruts were getting serious! In a funny way they were good though as they provided a guide to keep the wheels in when the bike was trying to slide sideways on both wheels!</p>

<p>We had a couple of stacks as we attempted some tricky and slippery sections of the DH trail but we managed to stay free of serious injury and broken bike bits.</p>

        <h1>Centennial Parklands cycling</h1>
        <p class="mulPara">As you are aware, in celebration of Moore Park’s 150th birthday in 2016 we have started a project to develop the first cohesive management plan for Moore Park. This will be the first time in the Park’s history such a plan has been created.</p>

 

<p>The following information will give an overview of what we have launched.</p>

 

 

<h3>WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING?</h3>

 

<p>We are undertaking early stage public consultation on a plan for the future of Moore Park. From now until 21 December 2015 all Moore Park stakeholders and the general public are invited to have their say, contribute their ideas or seek answers on the future of what is one of Australia’s most culturally important public parks.</p>

<h3>WHERE CAN I SEE THE INFORMATION AND/OR MAKE A SUBMISSION?</h3>

 

<p>There are two ways you can get involved:</p><p>Online exhibition and survey (open until 21 December 2015):<span class="paraLink"><a href="http://www.centennialparklands.com.au/mooreparkfuture"> Moore Park future</a></span></p>


 

<p>Pop-Up exhibitions and drop-in sessions: 11am to 2pm, every Wednesday and Saturday until 18 December 2015, at the Village Markets, Entertainment Quarter, Moore Park.</p>

 

 

 

<h3>HOW CAN I / MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS?</h3>

 

<p>The team at Elton Consulting have established a phone line and email service to field questions from the public. You can give these out:</p>
